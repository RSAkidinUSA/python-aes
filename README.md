# python-aes
A python implementation of AES

Developed by Ryan Burrow for VT MATH4175, Cryptography 1.

The initial modules I created for this implementation used string manipulation.
I am too stuborn to go back and change them to be more efficient and easier.
I have many regrets.
I may come back and change this at a later time.
